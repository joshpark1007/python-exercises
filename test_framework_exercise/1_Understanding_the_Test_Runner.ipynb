    "## So now you have seen two popular unit testing libraries for Python: unittest and pytest.\n",

    "Today, we're going to work on our _own_ unit testing framework and replicate some of the functionality that those test frameworks provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "A unit test library, at its most basic level, really needs two things: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **A runner:** A way to run all the tests at once. Otherwise, you could just manually call your functions one at a time and look at the result with your eyeballs to see if things are working.\n",
    "2. **Matchers:** Because when you run a bunch of tests at once, since you're not already queued in to the specific part of the code that's broken, you need clear messaging about what went wrong in the ones that failed and why, and you don't get that out of the box from your programming language itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we're going to start with the runner portion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In unittest, any test class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase` gets run when you run the unittest command in your directory. That behavior comes from the `TestCase` class itself. We're going to replicate that functionality now in our own class, called `PhoenixTest`. "
